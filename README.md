This is a repository created from Raspberry Pi OS. I will be using this repository to become more familiar with Linux.

## Using Raspberry Pi OS Headless

### Remote Access

Raspberry Pi OS can be accessed remotely using [SSH (Secure Shell)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md), which allows user to access the command line of a Raspberry Pi remotely from another computer or device on the same network.

Refer to [Setting up a Raspberry Pi headless](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) in order to set up the Pi OS without a monitor or keyboard.

### Remote Development using SSH

Instead of using ```nano``` or other CLI based editors, [Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) allows users to open a remote folder on any remote machine, virtual machine, or container with a running SSH server and take full advantage of VS Code's feature set.

## Monitoring Raspberry Pi OS

Proactive monitoring of the system is crucial for ensuring uptime. Critical system components will be monitored using the following scripts with ```cron``` which is scheduled to run ```system_health_check.py``` every hour.

* ```emails.py```
* ```system_health_check.py```

### Core Temperature

Core temperature is monitored using ```check_temperature``` method. If the core temperature rises above 80.0'C, the method sends an alert email.

### CPU Usage

CPU usage is monitored using ```check_cpu_usage``` method. If the CPU usage is over 80%, the method sends an alert email.

### Memory Usage

Memory usage is monitored using ```check_memoery_usage``` method. If the available memory is less than 500MB, the method sends an alert email.

### Disk Usage

Disk usage is monitored using ```check_disk_usage``` method. If the available memory is less than 20%, the method sends an alert email.
